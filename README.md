## Holden Tapp's Keyboard

All letters are input with just two button presses: One thumb Holds. One thumb Taps.
Left thumb first to access the left half of keyboard. Right thumb first for the right half.
Holding a single key carries no penalty. Releasing returns to neutral.
Each letter is always input the same way: Hold-'n-Tap.
Spaces are input by pressing both lower keys.
Button order for Space is redundant: left thumb to right thumb vs right to left.

Consistant muscle memory leads to even faster typing.
"With great power comes great responsiblilty."
(Letters are quick to type. Unfortunately, this means mistakes are just as quick.)
Backspace is mapped to the Left Bumper and always accessible.
As muscle memory builds, mistakes are "felt." (Just as it would while touch-typing.)
An inctinctive twitch of the finger to Backspace removes mistakes, before they are seen.

Left Trigger is used to Shift to Capital Letters
Right Trigger allows Numbers, Brackets, and Text Caret control.
Both Triggers accesses Symbols, Highlighting, and Clipboard Shortcuts.

Gestures can reduce the number of buttons down to just two cross-pads 
(8 buttons total. 4 for the left thumb, 4 for the right.)
This also allows greater adaptability to where the keyboard can be utilized.
This may include wearable rings, accessibility controllers, or VR interfaces.



## Holden Tapp's Mouse											
(Best on analog sticks, or twin cross-pads.)											
											
Whirling Thumbs clockwise / counter-clockwise will move the cursor.
However, whirling both Thumbs in tandem controls the X-Axis. Opposing directions controls Y-Axis.
This allows mirroring the inputs to build upon intuitive "swimming / paddling" motions.

Slowing one thumb curves diagonally, blending the path towards 45 degrees. (One thumb stopped)
Since both thumbs started the movement, there is less mental conflict for how to curve the path.

Hold-'n-Tap will jump the cursor to the respective cross. (Double Tap 2nd direction.)
Whirling one full rotation initially covers the distance to the next cross.
This allows the user to gauge the gesture required to quickly position the cursor.

Holding the cursor near the same position slows cursor for greater precision.
Full rotaions regain speed multiplier. Click or or Jump resets speed to full.

Release to neutral, then Double Down will Left Click / Confirm.
Double Down, then Whirl to allow Drag and Drop.
Down plus Left/Right allows for alternative Clicks and Scrolling (shown in the Down Taskbars).

Whirl a single stick inwards (2nd stick neutral) to open Sidebars like a drawer to expand functionality.
Allows for interacting with existing program elements (Navigation Panes, Tools, Menus, & Options)

Drawers can be reconfigured and custom tailored to each program.
Size of the drawer can match a program's existing Navigation Pane, Toolbar, Menu, or Quick Links.
The starting position can be snapped to the first (or most common) item.
The speed / precision of the cursor can be configured so a single input snaps to the next item.

Hold-'n-Tap could be overridden to select individual targets, such as drawing tools.
